#ifndef __CC_STREAM_H_
#define __CC_STREAM_H_

/* Note(yao): a stream supports serialized read/write of data, potentially over
 * a number of media: network sockets, file, shared memory, etc. While we have
 * not implemented all the underlying I/O mechanisms for each medium, we can
 * build an abstraction to provide a unified interface on top of them.
 *
 * From a service's perspective it needs a few essential parts: First, there
 * has to be channels over which requests/data arrive in order, such channels
 * can be TCP connections, Unix Domain Socket file desriptors, a consecutive
 * area in memory, among others. Second, there needs to be a destination and an
 * accompanying format at which the arrived data can be read into. This could
 * be as simple as a memory area, or something like the msg data structures
 * implemented in the ccommon library. Finally, given the protocols we will
 * need to support, there should be at least two ways to specify how much data
 * should/can be read from the channels: by length or by delimiter. A protocol
 * that relies on fixed-length fields or fields whose length are already known,
 * such as Redis, can use the former; protocols such as Memcached ASCII relies
 * on delimiters (and sometimes, size), so both are required to support them.
 *
 * To make the channel IO work with the rest of the service, we use callbacks.
 * Upon receiving a message or some data, a pre-defined routine is called; same
 * goes for sending messages/data.
 *
 * The idea described here is not dissimilar to the use of channels/streams
 * in Plan 9.

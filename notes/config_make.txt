## Maintaining configure.ac
Most projects have outdated configure.ac. Lacking much automating mechanisms, the author of the package has to manually update the macros that often reflect implementation and dependency details. Scripts may help and the auto tools themselves might eventually get better at this, but here are the list of things that often get ignored:
* check of header file dependencies (`AC_CHECK_HEADERS')
* library version info
* check of functions

## Flags
-g3: almost always a good idea
-fstrict-aliasing: this is currently used, but it breaks twemcache

## Making the case for non-resursive automake
As pointed out in [this page](https://www.flameeyes.eu/autotools-mythbuster/automake/nonrecursive.html " Non-recursive Automake"), there are several advantages to use non-recursive make. However, a huge Makefile.am is not necessarily more readable than small Makefile.am for each directory. So we use [inclusion](http://karelzak.blogspot.com/2013/02/non-recursive-automake.html) instead.
